HTTP1.1 VS HTTP2
* HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol
* it is the basis for almost all web applications
* HTTP is the method computers and servers use to request and send information


Hgit TTP1.1

The first usable version of HTTP was created in 1997

HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it. In contrast




HTTP2

In 2015, a new version of HTTP called HTTP/2 was created.
HTTP/2 solves several problems that the creators of HTTP/1.1 did not anticipate. 
In particular, HTTP/2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1. 
One of the ways in which HTTP/2 is faster is in how it prioritizes content during the loading process.
HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource. HTTP/2 does this by splitting data into binary-code messages and numbering these messages so that the client knows which stream each binary message belongs to
