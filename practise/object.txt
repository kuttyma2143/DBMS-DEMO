*****OBJECT*****************

In JavaScript, almost everything is an object. Objects are collections of key-value pairs, where each key is a string (or a Symbol) and each value can be any data type. Let me break it down for you:

Object Creation:
                You can create objects using literals (object initializer) or constructors.
Literals:       
                Define an object directly with curly braces {} and specify its properties and values.
Constructors:
                Use the Object() constructor to create an object.
Properties:
                Each object internally consists of properties.
                Properties have a key (or name) and a value.
Properties can be:
                Data properties: Contain a direct value.
